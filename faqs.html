          <h3>What is a business hackathon?</h3>
          <hr>
          <ul>
            <li><p>A business hackathon is a spinoff of the traditional Hackathon where hackers (developers & engineers), hipsters (designers) and hustlers (business-types) come together to develop a viable product/service and pitch it in a weekend.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Who can participate?</h3>
          <hr>
          <ul>
            <li><p>All current undergraduate and graduate students with a valid student ID are allowed to participate. Students who have graduated within 6 months before HackATL can also participate.</p>
            <p>While graduate students can participate in HackATL, we limit 1 graduate student per 2 undergraduate students. For example, a team of 6 may have no more than 2 graduate students. </p>
            <p>Everyone is welcome to attend speaker events and workshops.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Prizes</h3>
          <hr>
          <ul>
            <li><p>There will be amazing prizes! In the past, we have had combined cash prizes of up to $14,000 and lots of in-kind perks for the winning teams. Stay tuned ;)</p></li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Does it have to be a new idea?</h3>
          <hr>
          <ul>
            <li><p>It doesn’t have to be a new idea, but you cannot have any previous code, presentation materials, financial forecasts, or designs. Come with an undeveloped idea or be open to finding one.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <h3>What else is there to do besides the competition?</h3>
          <hr>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Games & team building activities (think Escape the Room), speaker events, entrepreneurship panels, & workshop sessions</p></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="listRight">
          <h3>What if I can't code?</h3>
          <hr>
          <ul>
            <li><p>No business, design, or coding experience is required for you to participate in HackATL. According to Forbes Magazine, startups need three members - hackers, hustlers and hipsters. Whether you are a technical genius, a creative prodigy, or a practical business-type, there is a need for you.    </p>
            <p>This year, HackATL strives to not only be a platform for you to build a business, but also a venue for you to learn how to do that. We’ll have workshops in ideation, design, web dev, and pitching all throughout the weekend to help you bring your ideas to life. </p></li>
          </ul>
          <h3>How do competition rounds work?</h3>
          <hr>
          <ul>
            <li><p>All registered teams are going to pitch their idea and product to judges in the Preliminary round.</p>
            <p>The top winners of preliminary will receive prizes from each category sponsor, and they will advance to the Final round (a total of 8 teams). Each team will pitch again to final round judges, and the top 3 teams will receive the grand prizes in order. </p>
            <p>For both rounds, teams will be evaluated based on business feasibility, demo / product quality, and presentation (full criteria coming soon). </p></li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Who can I work with? How big can my team be?</h3>
          <hr>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Anyone - teams must have a minimum of 2 members and go up to 6. Make sure that every member in your team has designated roles & responsibilities - the more you treat it like a real business, the more manageable things will get as the event progresses.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <h3>What if I don't have a team?</h3>
          <hr>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Then you are in the most normal and in fact, ideal situation! HackATL is a platform for you to collaborate and network with people of diverse backgrounds. Leverage our networking sessions on Day 1 (Friday 10/2) to find your ideal business partners!</p></li>
