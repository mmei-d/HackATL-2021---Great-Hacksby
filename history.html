        <p>The beginning of HackATL was inspired a group of 5 passionate college students who wanted to bring entrepreneurship to life at Emory University. </p>
        <p>Hosted at Goizueta Business School, HackATL was the first-ever hackathon to be entirely student-run and organized at the university.</p>

        <p>Under 3 distinct areas, <b>Consumer Technology, Health & Wellness, and Social Enterprise</b>, the Competition Categories allowed all aspiring entrepreneurs to push their ideas and think more critically about solving the world's most pressing issues. </p>

        </h1>
        <p>Only a century ago, the world experienced a period of tremendous challenge and difficulty. With everything from a global pandemic, high levels of consumer debt, and even rising income inequality weighing society down, it seemed that these obstacles would be insurmountable. However, the 1920’s aren’t remembered for those challenges -- they’re remembered for the incredible innovation that resulted from the challenges. From TVs and traffic lights to band-aids and vacuum cleaners, the world became a much better place, and ‘20s roared to life. 
 Given that we’re seeing these same issues resurface in today’s world, we want our participants to use this as a source of inspiration. Whether it’s creating a simple loan app to reduce foreclosures, making a virtual platform to connect individuals in social isolation, or easing public fear by making economic indicators simple and accessible, we want hackers to innovate solutions to today’s largest dilemmas against all odds.</p>
